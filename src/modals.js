                            After I took CS4400: Introduction to Database Systems in the fall of 2024, I knew I wanted to TA the class.
                            The class was one of the most useful classes I had taken at Georgia Tech thus far, as almost any field of 
                            software engineering involves at least some knowledge of how to interact with both relational and non-relational
                            databases. Over the course of the fall 2024 semester, I had come to recognize the value of a strong
                            understanding of SQL. After applying for the role and passing the interview, I became a TA for the class.

                        <p>
                            As a new TA, I had several responsibilities in the role. Standard procedure for all TAs include grading, attending 
                            lecture, attending a weekly TA meeting, and holding two office hours per week to provide personalized, one-on-one 
                            help to students. Each one of us had additional responsibilities to improve the course in various ways. I created 
                            explaining concepts important for completing the class project, including creating EERD diagrams, and writing SQL
                            functions and stored procedures. Near the end of the semester, I was put in charge of managing the quizzes given
                            in class to assess understanding of course content, a role I will fully step into next semester.

                        In the summer of 2024, I interned at Capital One as a Software Engineering Intern in McLean, Virginia. I was one of about 
                        60 interns in the Technology Early Internship Program (TEIP), Capital Oneâ€™s SWE Intern program for freshman and sophomores. 
                        The first half of my ten-week internship was dedicated to attending classes covering modern software engineering technologies 
                        and languages, such as Node.js, React.js, SQL, AWS, and more. The second half was spent working on a project with other TEIP interns 
                        using the skills we had learned in the first half.

                            and have a chance to deploy a website using Vercel. The UI is made with React and Bootstrap.
